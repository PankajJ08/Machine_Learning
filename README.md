# Deep Learning on Fashion MNIST dataset using Pytorch

  This is the jupyter notebook that contains the Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) to classify the correct class on dataset.
  I'd used Pytorch as deep learning framework. I got the test accuracy of 93%. 
  You must have the basic knowledge of CNN and general deep learning concepts to implement the code.
